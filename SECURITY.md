# Security Policy

Thank you for taking time reading the following information carefully. Your [contribution](CONTRIBUTING.md) is highly welcomed!

## Supported versions

Only the **latest stable release** is supported with security updates.

## Reporting a vulnerability

I highly encourage you to follow the principles of a **[responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure)**:

-   Do not publish your research before contacting me first.
-   [Write me an e-mail][mail]
-   Sign and encrypt your e-mail with OpenPGP/GnuPG.
-   Do not open a public issue until my confirmation.
-   If the vulnerability is accepted please give me at least 4 weeks to release proper security updates.
-   After the security updates are released feel free to publish your research. A CVE is highly appreciated.

**Note:** This is a private side-project, maintained in my spare time. Therefore, I can't promise to answer you within three days but I try to respond within 3-5 days.

Thank you.
