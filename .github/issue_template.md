### Environment

| Question                  | Answer            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- |
| idoit/apiclient version  | x.y.z             |

### Logs and other useful output

<!--
Please note:

1.  Server logs may help to understand what exactly went wrong.
2.  Problems are often caused not on client but on server-side.
3.  Anonymize your logs properly. Do not post any passwords/secrets/private data.
4.  Make sure i-doit's own logging and Apache error logging are enabled.
5.  Increase PHP's log level on both client and server-side if necessary.
6.  Paste only excerpts from the logs which seem to be useful for further investigation.
7.  Paste your logs to a private gist and provide a link to it.
