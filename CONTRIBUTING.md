# Contribution

Thank you very much for your interest in this project! There are plenty of ways you can support us. :-)

## Code of Conduct

We like you to read and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. Thank you.

## Use it

The best and (probably) easiest way to help is to use this library in your own projects. It would be very nice to share your thoughts with us. We love to hear from you.

If you have questions how to use it properly read the [documentation](README.md) carefully.

## Report bugs

If you find something strange please report it to [our issue tracker][issues].

## Report security issues

[Found a security-related issue?](SECURITY.md)

## Make a wish

Of course, there are some features in the pipeline. However, if you have good ideas how to improve this library please let us know! Write a feature request [in our issue tracker][issues].

## Setup a development environment

If you like to contribute source code, documentation snippets, self-explaining examples or other useful bits, fork this repository, setup the environment and make a pull request.

~~~ {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-api-client-php.git
~~~

If you have a GitHub account create a fork first and then clone the repository.

After that, setup the environment with Composer:

~~~ {.bash}
composer install
~~~

Now it is the time to do your stuff. Do not forget to commit your changes. When you are done consider to make a pull requests.

Notice, that any of your contributions merged into this repository will be [licensed under the AGPLv3](LICENSE).

## Requirements

Developers must meet these requirements:

-   See requirements mentioned in the [documentation](README.md)
-   [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/), needed for code coverage with phpunit
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   One or more working copies of [i-doit](https://i-doit.com/) (otherwise this API client library is senseless)

## Use a Docker environment

As an alternative to a local environment you can run everything inside a [Docker container](https://docker.com/). To make it easy there is already a `Dockerfile` available in the root directory of this repository. Build the image and run the container:

~~~ {.bash}
docker build . -t idoitapi:latest
docker run -it --rm --name idoitapi -v "$PWD":/usr/src idoitapi:latest
~~~

This executes `composer list` by default. It's possible to run any other command. For example, if you're right at the beginning run `composer install` insight the container:

~~~ {.bash}
docker run -it --rm --name idoitapi -v "$PWD":/usr/src idoitapi:latest composer install
~~~

## Run unit tests

There is a huge amount of tests located under `tests/`. These tests can be executed by [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/). We test both this client library and the i-doit JSON-RPC API as well.

### Prerequisites

1.  Copy file `.env.dist` to `.env`
2.  Put your configuration settings to `.env`

### Usage

Execute tests for all released features:

~~~ {.bash}
composer phpunit
~~~

At the end you get the result of a code coverage analysis.

Run these tests in parallel to produce a higher load:

~~~ {.bash}
composer parallel
~~~

Run all tests in debug mode using [Xdebug](https://xdebug.org/):

~~~ {.bash}
bin/phpunit-dbg
~~~

If you configure your system properly, you will be able to set breakpoints in your IDE.

You may add arguments and options, for example:

~~~ {.bash}
bin/phpunit-dbg --group unreleased tests/APITest.php
~~~

### Available test groups

Some tests are grouped. Include a group by `--group` or exclude it by `--exclude-group`.

| Group name    | Description                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `unreleased`  | Unreleased features in the i-doit JSON-RPC API    |
| `open`        | Still open issues in the i-doit JSON-RPC API      |
| `issues`      | Perform tests for reported issues                 |
| `ABC-123`     | Perform tests for reported issue `ABC-123`        |

## Release new version

â€¦and publish it to [packagist.org][packagist]. You need commit rights for this repository.

1.  Bump version: `composer config extra.version <VERSION>`
2.  Update composer: `composer update`
3.  Keep [`README.md`](README.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) up-to-date
4.  Commit changes: `git commit -a -m "Bump version to $(composer config extra.version)"`
5.  Perform some tests, for example `composer ci`
6.  Run unit tests: `composer phpunit`
7.  Create Git tag: `git tag -s -a -m "Release version $(composer config extra.version)" $(composer config extra.version)`
8.  Push changes: `git push --follow-tags`

There is already a webhook enabled to push the code from GitHub to Packagist.
